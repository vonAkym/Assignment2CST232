# Disk Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS and SCAN

This C++ project implements two disk scheduling algorithms: **First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS)** and **SCAN**. The program simulates the movement of the disk head based on a series of I/O requests and calculates the total seek time for each algorithm.

## Features

- **FCFS (First-Come, First-Serve)**: Processes I/O requests in the order they arrive.
- **SCAN**: Moves the disk arm towards one end of the disk, processes all the requests in that direction, then reverses and processes the requests in the opposite direction.

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler (e.g., `g++`, `cl.exe`)
- C++11 or later
